# Calc
A remake of a calculator


Requirements:
Layout and Design 
Use HTML and CSS to create a visually appealing calculator interface.
Design the calculator with a grid-based layout that includes buttons for numbers (0-9), decimal point, arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /), equal sign (=), clear button (C), and any other additional features you may choose to include.
Ensure that the calculator is responsive and displays well on different screen sizes (mobile, tablet & desktop).
Functionality
Implement JavaScript logic to handle user interactions and perform calculations.
The calculator should support the following operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Enable users to input numbers and perform calculations by clicking the buttons or using the keyboard.
Display the entered numbers, current operation, and final result on the calculator screen.
Implement a clear button that resets the calculator to its initial state.
Error Handling
Handle scenarios such as division by zero or any other potential errors gracefully.
Display appropriate error messages or prevent invalid operations from occurring.
Code Quality and Organization
Write clean, well-structured, and readable code.
Use appropriate naming conventions for variables, functions, and classes.
Separate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into their respective files.
Comment your code to explain complex logic or any crucial steps.
Include a README.md file that provides instructions on using the calculator and any additional notes you want to share.
Optional Challenge:
Add additional features to enhance the calculator's functionality, such as memory functions (M+, M-, MR, MC), percentage calculations, exponentiation, or any other advanced features you may choose.
Implement a history log that records the previous calculations and allows users to view and recall them.

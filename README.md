# Calc
A remake of a calculator

# How to use Caclulator 

# You can either press the buttons on the screen or use the keybpard buttons, however on a mac computer if you wanna do addition you have to do shift + "=" key to symbolize addition. and then the return key equals the "=" sign. 

# The clapping button is just a sound addition I added because I have not worked with using audio in html yet and I wanted to try it out.

# You can choose your own calculator style they all work the same it just changes the color..
